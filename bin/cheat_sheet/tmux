# get pts for panes
interactive: tmux display-pane -d 2000 'display-message -p -t %% "#D #{pane_tty}" > xxx'

in the receiving pane: readlink /proc/$$/fd/1

in the sending pane: cat > the pts listed by the above command

tmux can list the pts: tmux list-panes -a -F '#D #{pane_tty}'

tmux has a pipe-pane that could work (example below is probably wrong)
tmux pipe-pane -o -t 0.2 'cat > /dev/pts/5'

# key to show hide statusbar
bind-key F3 set-option -g status

# chose where to move the current pane
tmux choose-tree -Z "join-pane -t '%%'; resize-pane -Z"

# bind shortcut to command that executes in the current directory
tmux bind C-F run-shell 'tmux new-window -n ftl ftl "#{pane_current_path}"'
